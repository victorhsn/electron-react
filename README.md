# A simple start with Electron + ReactJS
Electron + ReactJS

This repository was created just to show how we can run Electron + ReactJS. 

To install all dependencies 

```sh
$ npm install 
```

I committed the bundle.js, but if you'll change anything at app.js, you must execute the command below to bundle it. 

```sh
$ npm run webpack
```

Run the app

```sh
$ npm start
````
